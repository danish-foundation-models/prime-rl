    deviation makes the policy gradient unbiased for the order-``group_size``

    ~1/p weight; ``group_size`` interpolates REINFORCE at 1 → exact maximum
    likelihood as it grows).

    <= 0 carries no signal and gets zero advantages (the zero-advantage filter
    drops it, matching the paper's no-success convention)."""
